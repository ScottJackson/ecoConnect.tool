**Core**. The _Index of Ecological Integrity_ (IEI), is an estimate of the ecological integrity---the ability of a site
to support biodiversity and ecosystem processes over the long term---based on several landscape metrics. IEI is estimated 
at four scales, ranking each site within the entire northeastern United States, its state, its TNC terrestrial ecoregion, 
and its HUC 6 watershed. https://umassdsl.org/DSLdocs//DSL_documentation_iei.pdf

**Connect**. _ecoConnect_ provides a regional multi-scale ecoSystem-based estimate of regional connectivity throughout the Northeast. ecoConnect is independent of pre-defined conservation targets, connecting sites with high IEI throughout the landscape based on ecological systems, development, roads, and bridges.
For a given ecosystem, it gives a measure of each each site's contribution to regional connectivity. https://umassdsl.org/data/ecoConnect
